            "This article provides an introduction to the core concepts of vectors, tokens, and embeddings, which are essential for understanding how large language models (LLMs) process language. Vectors are numerical representations of data that allow LLMs to process text and images. Tokens are the basic units of data processed by LLMs, and they can be words, parts of words, or even characters. Embeddings are vectors that capture the semantic meaning and context of text, enabling LLMs to understand the nuances and subtleties of language. These concepts are fundamental to LLMs and form the backbone of their ability to perform tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.\"\n"
